# CobblestoneEnergy-Dubai ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started ðŸŽ²:

ðŸ”­ Cobblestone Energy is an independent trading firm. Founded in 2017, we are part of the next generation of companies defining the future of global commodity trading. We specialise in the proprietary trading of the intraday and short-term wholesale electricity markets across Europe. We make use of advanced data analytics and extensive research to drive profitable decision making, trading enough electricity every day to power a small country and growing every day. Technology and risk management form the backbone of our business.

ðŸŒ± Born in London and raised around the world! We have operated in and sourced talent from multiple countries around the world including UK, Taiwan, and Uganda. In 2020, in order to align with our growth ambitions and have access to talent from across the world, we moved our headquarters to the international city of Dubai. We have continued the growth from our new home, welcoming many different nationalities to the team every month. We passionately believe that talent can be found everywhere, and diversity of experiences, backgrounds and ideas are one of our greatest assets.

ðŸ‘¯ At Cobblestone Energy, we do not define diversity by gender, race, background or any other form of social construct. Rather, by opinion, experience, perspective and potential. We focus on talent and strong cultural compatibility recognising that this can arise from different social backgrounds. We cherish and respect different opinions, perspectives, and styles of communication.

ðŸ’¬ We are profoundly serious about work. But the team is cool, the work is fulfilling, and Thursdays allow for casual attire. We work together in a fascinating way. We tell it straight as it is, take feedback correctly, and have fun together. We are a group of people that are passionate about work and talk about it a lot more than we probably should but only because we enjoy it.
